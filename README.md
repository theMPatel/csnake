# Snake in C

The awesome game of snake written in C!

Growing up, I would play this game on my dad's cell phone all the time. 
I thought to my self it would be cool to implement this game and learn a new language!

## How to play

  1. Movement keys: WASD
     ->As of right now, you must hold the key for you to get movement since the getchar() library
     function blocks until an input is received. Currently working on this so that everything
     moves automatically
  
  2. The size of the Snake landscape is determined at runtime. That is to say, if you'd like to have a bigger playing
     field, increase the size of your terminal prior to running the compiled binary.
    
  3. Go eat some apples!!!!!
